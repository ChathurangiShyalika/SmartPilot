#### 1. **Neuro-Symbolic Design**
The system leverages a **neuro-symbolic approach**, which combines:
   - **Neural Networks**: We use **Autoencoders, Efficientnet CNN and Fully Connected Network** in anomaly prediction, **LSTM Models** in demand forecasting.
   - We use manufacturing process-ontologies, knowledge graphs and structured knowledge sources as knowledge sources.
   - 
#### 2. **Customization to the industrial-based applications**

The system is designed to be highly flexible and customizable to selected industrial-based applications:
   - It accepts multimodal data(sensor data and images) in anomaly prediction, sensor data in forecasting and manufacturing manuals (in text format) and sensor data in information retrieving.

#### 3. **Compactness: Lightweight and Efficient Models**

Despite its powerful neuro-symbolic design, the system is highly efficient:
   - Each individual agent is small, operates efficiently using minimal computational overhead.
   - The **SentenceTransformer model** used in this system, `MiniLM-L6-v2`, is a compact and efficient transformer-based language model with only **33 million parameters**, significantly smaller than many other transformer models like BERT or GPT.
